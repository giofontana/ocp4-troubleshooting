= How to Replace All Masters in an OpenShift IPI Cluster

This procedure was created with my friend Rafael Pécora (*link:https://github.com/pecorawal[@pecorawal]*) and it is based on link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-1-infra-recovery.html[OpenShift documentation].

[NOTE]
====
This procedure has been tested on OpenShift 4.3 and it does not apply to version 4.4 and above.
====

In this article I am going to show how to replace all masters servers, in case you need to restore your cluster of masters and etcds.

To do so, you will need to have at least one functional master/etcd server still working or at least you should have a recent backup to recover one of the masters and start the recovery process.

Therefore we should run the following tasks:

. <<ETCD Backup>>: Backup one of the remaining funcional master nodes. In our case this will be the server master-0 (etcd-0).
. <<Restore backup and etcd cluster>>: Restore backup selecting one etcd member only in the cluster (in our case will be the master-0/etcd-0)
. <<Remove 2 masters nodes>>: Remove other 2 masters nodes (master-1/etcd-1 and master-2/etcd-2)
. <<Recreate masters>>: Recreate both machines (master-1 and master-2)
. <<Update DNS and LB records>>
. <<Run etcd tokenize>> on the remaining funcional master node (master-0/etcd-0)
. <<Run etcd-member-recover for new members>> (master-1/etcd-1 and master-2/etcd-2)

Now you already have your cluster of masters entirely functional and recovered. Only to exercise this process a little bit more, we will also replace the first master node (master-0/etcd-0). In order to do that, we will add the following tasks to our procedure:

[start=8]
. <<Remove the etcd member etcd-0>> (master-0/etcd-0)
. <<Remove server master-0>>
. <<Create a new server master-0>> (master-0/etcd-0)
. <<Update DNS and LB records>>
. <<Run etcd tokenize>> on one of remaining funcional master node (now can be either master-1/etcd-1 or master-2/etcd-2)
. <<Run etcd-member-recover for new the member>> (master-0/etcd-0)


== ETCD Backup

The first step we should follow is to have a funcional backup of the cluster etcd. If you lost your entire cluster, you should restore it from an existing etcd backup that you should already have (in this case you already have your backup and you can skip this step). This process is documented in the OpenShift official process.footnote:[https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.html]

In our case, we elect the *master-0* as the remaining funcional node.

== Restore backup and etcd cluster

Now we should restore the backup selecting etcd-0 as the only etcd member in the cluster. We should do this to restore the etcd cluster quorum and, as such, restoring access to our OpenShift api and console.

This procedure should be done in our remaining funcional node or the first member selected to be recovered. In our case this is the server master-0/etcd-0.

*Procedure:*
----
# Copy the backup to our remaining funcional node (or the first member selected to be recovered):
[root@ocp-bastion recover-master-2]# scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa etcd-20200522-bkp.tgz core@10.0.140.240:/home/core/

Some minutes after above procedure you should have your cluster functional again. After that, check if we only have etcd-0 in our etcd cluster:

== Remove 2 masters nodes 

(master-1/etcd-1 and master-2/etcd-2)

Now we should remove problematic master nodes to replace them further. Before deleting them let's export their machine configurations to be used to recreate them.

*Procedure:*
----
# Export master-0
[root@ocp-bastion install]# oc get machine $(oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide | grep master-0 | awk '{ print $1 }') -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml > new-master-0.yaml
# Export master-1
[root@ocp-bastion install]# oc get machine $(oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide | grep master-1 | awk '{ print $1 }') -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml > new-master-1.yaml
# Export master-2
[root@ocp-bastion install]# oc get machine $(oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide | grep master-2 | awk '{ print $1 }') -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml > new-master-2.yaml
----

Now we can remove masters 1 and 2.

*Procedure:*
----
# Remove master-1
[root@ocp-bastion install]# oc delete machine -n openshift-machine-api $(oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide | grep master-1 | awk '{ print $1 }')
machine.machine.openshift.io "ocp-w2lhz-master-1" deleted
# Remove master-2
[root@ocp-bastion install]# oc delete machine -n openshift-machine-api $(oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide | grep master-2 | awk '{ print $1 }')
machine.machine.openshift.io "ocp-w2lhz-master-2" deleted
----

At this time, your cluster may become nonfunctional again:
----
[root@ocp-bastion install]# oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api 
The connection to the server api.ocp.rhbr-labs.com:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
----

If you get this problem you can remove the servers manually on AWS and restore the backup again in the master-0 (step above).
----
[core@ip-10-0-140-240 ~]$ export INITIAL_CLUSTER="etcd-member-ip-10-0-140-240.ec2.internal=https://etcd-0.ocp.rhbr-labs.com:2380"
[core@ip-10-0-140-240 ~]$ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/etcd-snapshot-restore.sh /home/core/assets/backup $INITIAL_CLUSTER

After some minutes that you recovered your backup you will see that the api will become functional again, but still showing master-1 and master-2 (because at the time of your backup both servers still exists). Wait up to 10 minutes and the OpenShift will move those masters to "Failed" state:
----

Now remove the machines again:

Now we will use the machine config yaml files that you exported before.

*Procedure:*

[root@ocp-bastion install]# vi new-master-1.yaml

== Update DNS and LB records

Now we already have our 3 masters online again, however we still have only one etcd running on the cluster (on master-0). In the next steps we will deploy etcd on the new masters and add them to the etcd cluster.

The first step we need to update is the DNS and LoadBalancer in the AWS console. 

*Procedure:*

To do so, get the IP address of the new servers in the AWS Console:

.Get Instance IP Address
image::images/replace-masters/aws-ec2-get-ip.png[]

Now open the HostedZone for OCP in Route53:

.AWS Hosted Zones
image::images/replace-masters/aws-hosted-zones.png[]

Finally update the records etcd-1 and etcd-2 for this cluster:

.AWS Hosted Zones
image::images/replace-masters/aws-update-zone.png[]

LoadBalancer is automatically updated if you are running an IPI cluster. If you are using an UPI cluster, you should manually update your LB also.

== Run etcd tokenize

Now we need to start the etcd-signer in the master-0.

<1> IP 10.0.136.116 is the server functional master, where etcd-signer is running. In our case this is the master-0.

Now you have etcd functional in two masters (master-0 and master-1):

That's all you need to recover a cluster of masters. The steps below is only to exercise this process a little bit more.

== Replace master-0/etcd-0

This step is not required. This is only for testing purposes.

=== Remove the etcd member etcd-0

*Procedure:*
----
# SSH to master-1 or master-2
[root@ocp-bastion recover-master-2]# ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa core@ip-10-0-137-235.ec2.internal
# Run script to remove etcd-0 from the cluster

etcd member etcd-member-ip-10-0-140-240.ec2.internal with 890a07c73df999b0 successfully removed..
----

=== Remove server master-0

*Procedure:*
----
[root@ocp-bastion recover-master-2]# oc delete machine -n openshift-machine-api $(oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide | grep master-0 | awk '{ print $1 }')
machine.machine.openshift.io "ocp-w2lhz-master-0" deleted

In the step below, sometimes you will see that OpenShift will be stuck in Deleting phase.

If you get this problem, terminate the server manually on AWS and it will disappear in OpenShift after some minutes.

== Update DNS and LB records

*Procedure:*

.Get Instance IP Address
image::images/replace-masters/aws-ec2-get-ip.png[]

Now open the HostedZone for OCP in Route53:

.AWS Hosted Zones
image::images/replace-masters/aws-hosted-zones.png[]

Finally update the records etcd-1 and etcd-2 for this cluster:

.AWS Hosted Zones
image::images/replace-masters/aws-update-zone.png[]

LoadBalancer is automatically updated if you are running an IPI cluster. If you are using an UPI cluster, you should manually update your LB also.

== Run etcd tokenize

Now we need to start the etcd-signer in the master-1.
